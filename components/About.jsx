          The initial idea behind this project is that i think serious music nerds should not only rely on algorithm recommendation, instead explore music based on your favorite artists. A good hint of this method in music is song covering—a cover is a tribute. Want to know who are influenced by your favorite artists and your fav artists are influenced by whom? Go to find all the cover data of them!

          secondhandsongs.com is a good place for this, however it doesn’t provide a good GUI interface. Therefore, this project is to help.
